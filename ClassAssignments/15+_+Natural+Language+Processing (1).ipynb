The main difference between the two is in the inputs to fitting and transforming. The [Vectorizer's fit/transform](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.fit) take an input of text whereas the [transformer's](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.fit) take an input of a BoW vector. Given that we already determined the BoW vectors, it would be more time efficient to use TfidfTransformer."

In order to get to the right place, I\\nshould clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation\\narea.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may\\nhave been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is\\nabout 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles\\noverlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably\\nmaintained (I ran it about 70mph).\\n\\nLooking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on \\nthe world.

I\\'ve put together a list and\\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I\\'m currently looking for\\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \\ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \\nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor\\'s cat, etc...)  \\nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \\nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\\n\\nOk, Here\\'s the list:\\n\\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\\n\\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t seem \\n\\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\\n\\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \\n\\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I\\'ll send you a copy) \\n\\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can\\'t return it to \\n\\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don\\'t know how to set) \\n\\tso maybe that\\'s the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn\\'t\\n\\twork so I\\'m trying to minimize my losses.\\t~$45\\n\\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\\n\\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\\n\\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\\n\\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\\t~$45\\n\\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \\n\\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\\n\\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\\n\\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\\n\\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\\n\\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \\n\\tproject.\\t~$20\\n\\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\\n\\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\\n\\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\\n\\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn\\'t sending\\n\\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \\n\\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\\n\\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \\n\\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I\\'m not that good\\n\\tat soldering so I couldn\\'t do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\\n\\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\\n\\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\\n\\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\\n\\tExcel, and many others) \\n\\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\\n\\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \\n\\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\\n\\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn\\'t fix it.  I just don\\'t \\n\\thave time to play with it any more.\\t~$65\\n\\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\\n\\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\\n\\thave some tech documents on it.

I have no idea how \\n\\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you\\'re interested.\\n\\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven\\'t tested this one out yet, but if anyone \\n\\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\\n\\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\\n\\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn\\'t be used without \\n\\tanother controller chip.

It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes\\nthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet\\nmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed\\nmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my\\ntruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts\\nrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet \\nsays that the noise is \"a characteristic of the transmission.\"\\n\\nAlso, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the\\ngear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about\\n55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,\\nthe RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should\\npoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a\\ndetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They\\ndropped the compression ratio, supposedly for \"engine longevity\"\\nreasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.\\nOther things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times \\nso far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being\\nshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between\\nstabilizer and control arm fell off).\\n\\nAny company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What\\nreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt\\nto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for \\nthem to attempt to fix it one more time.

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain.

But before I do, I want to \\nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \\nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \\ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \\nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \\nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \\nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \\nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \\na problem with one of these diseases, don\\'t use what I\\'m going to tell you \\nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \\nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \\nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that\\'s why I\\'m here).  When \\nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn\\'t say, don\\'t worry my vitamin \\nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \\nplan and simple.  If it\\'s begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \\nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \\nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor\\'s office as fast as \\nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \\nregular basis, my wife kept putting her\\'s off, both myself and her \\ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \\nscheduled one, but she didn\\'t show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \\nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\\n\\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \\nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \\nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \\ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \\nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \\nminerals are being used.  I\\'m not saying that some of this stuff couldn\\'t \\nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \\nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D\\'s who wrote the new \\nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \\ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \\nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \\nhandle stress.  That\\'s where I\\'m coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\\nI\\'m not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \\ndon\\'t care.  I\\'m averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \\nthat I\\'ve got something important to say.  But I\\'m also getting hit by a \\nfew with an axe to grind.  That\\'s life.\\n\\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \\nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \\nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \\nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \\nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \\nchelate(chromium picolinate) it\\'s absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \\nfor all the minerals).  I\\'ve been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \\ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \\ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \\ndo any harm.  I wouldn\\'t do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \\nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \\n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \\nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \\ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \\nType II diabetes but I\\'m not going to because for each positive one, there \\nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I\\'m convinced that the problem is \\nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \\nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \\nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \\nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \\nconcerned\\n\\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \\nthis possible link with chromium isn\\'t too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \\nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \\nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \\nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \\npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \\nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \\nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \\npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \\njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \\nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \\nfound in older people, it\\'s not too surprising that chromium was low in the \\nRBC\\'s.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \\nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \\ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\\n\\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \\nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \\nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \\nanalysis for you, but I wouldn\\'t use them.  There is just too much funny \\nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\\n\\nHere\\'s Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \\nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \\navailable(they don\\'t like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \\nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \\nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \\nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \\nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \\nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \\nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\\n\\nWhat\\'s my advise?  Don\\'t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \\nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \\nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \\na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \\nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \\nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan\\'s new Clinical Nutrition textbook \\nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \\ntolerance.  If you can\\'t do that, I\\'ll find a doctor who can, thank you \\nvery much.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n', 'From: adn6285@ritvax.isc.rit.edu\\nSubject: MR2 parts\\nNntp-Posting-Host: vaxa.isc.rit.edu\\nReply-To: adn6285@ritvax.isc.rit.edu\\nOrganization: Rochester Institute of Technology\\nLines: 4\\n\\nDoes anyone know of a dead first generation MR2?

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \\'overgrazed\\',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I\\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \\'perfect\\' in the\\nphrase, \\'created... perfect and without flaw\\'? To my mind, a \\'perfect\\'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A \\'perfect\\' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system.

Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\\n    sci.astro.\\n\\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\\n\\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\\nboth have souls.

St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus\\'s \"Against\\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian\\'s \"On Baptism\".

In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \\nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.'

He was a murderer from the \\n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \\n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.

First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?

Crown Publishers, \\nInc., New York (1952). \\n(Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 \\n million Muslim people)\\n\\np. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).\\n\\n \\'The most are inside houses.

Him you must see.\\'\\n \"We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....\\n \\'I don\\'t believe you,\" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door.

Rags strewed the mud floor around an \\n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \\n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \\n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man\\'s body lying face \\n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \\n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \\n as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so \\n I\\'d no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  \\n slashed genitals.\"\\n\\np. 363 (first paragraph). \\n\\n \\'How many people lived there?\\'\\n \\'Oh, about eight hundred.\\' He yawned.\\n \\'Did you see any Turk officers?\\'\\n \\'No, sir.

We\\'d close in on three\\n sides.\\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\\n\"But the women and children?\"\\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\\n\\np. 360.\\n\\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \\n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. \\'Djul lies under that,\\' said \\n Dro, pointing. \\'Our men also attack from the other sides.\\'\\n\\n Then, \\'Whee-ee!\\' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \\n I heard our Utica brass roar.\\n\\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\\n The came a shrill wailing.\\n\\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.

Others pantomimed them in escape\\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women\\'s cries.\\n\\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \\n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.

As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.

WHere are they.\\nOriginator: news@nimaster\\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\\nOrganization: Princeton University\\nLines: 51\\n\\n\\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\nBATSE press releases.\\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n', 'From: wex@cs.ulowell.edu (Paul M.

(I am almost\\nsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be\\nwrong.  Oh well, I don\\'t have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don\\'t feel\\nlike thinking through it right now.)\\n \\nWhat is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\\nis exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes\\n(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals\\nmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.\\nThe reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery\\ncharger) is put back into the battery.\\n \\nLead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each\\ncell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts\\n(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric\\nenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it\\nhas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So\\nwhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.\\n \\nTo understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on\\nconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier\\'s\\nPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will\\nact to move to a more comfortable position.

Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder\\nare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity\\nof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4\\ntimes greater than wood.\\n \\nIt is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on\\nconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the\\ndischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity\\nor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)\\nDuring storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on\\nthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity\\nsurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity\\nsurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom\\nsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,\\nthe battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster\\nthan that on dirt.\\n \\nThis is where LeChatelier\\'s principle comes into play.  Removing energy from\\nthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the\\nreaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that\\ntemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is\\na better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner\\nof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which\\n\"pulls\" the reaction along.\\n \\nAlso, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric\\nacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.\\n \\nJeff White      jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\\n \\n\"How do I get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?\"  French fries!\\n', \"From: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Vesselin Bontchev)\\nSubject: Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more.\\nReply-To: bontchev@fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de\\nOrganization: Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg\\nDistribution: na\\nLines: 33\\n\\nandersom@spot.Colorado.EDU (Marc Anderson) writes:\\n\\n> methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''\\n> Clinton said.

If you want the full document, ask me by mail\\n--Rex] \\n\\n\\n   \"Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\\nnature.\\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\\nperfection of the Godhead.\\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\\npossession of the double natures.  Christ\\'s human nature is impersonal, in that\\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\\nMan. Nature is defined:\\n\\n\"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\\nunchangeable.\"\\n\\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \\nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\\nare simply human or simply divine.\"\\n\\n\\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it\\'s not entirely\\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That\\'s the position that\\nChrist\\'s two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\\n\\nNormally people who talk about Christ\\'s human nature as being\\n\"impersonal\" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\\nare using \"person\" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called \"anhypostasia\".\\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.\\n\\n--clh]\\n', 'From: swf@elsegundoca.ncr.com (Stan Friesen)\\nSubject: Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\nReply-To: swf@elsegundoca.ncr.com\\nLines: 43\\n\\nIn article <May.5.02.52.59.1993.28865@athos.rutgers.edu>, you write:\\n|> \\n|> [Yes.

Someones even made the statement that science is\\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\\n\\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\n    observable phenomenon.\\n\\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \\nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \\n\\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \\nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\\n\\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\\'t seem to have an\\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \\nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \\n\\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\\nmanner you won\\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone\\'s face,\"\\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\\nmorality. \\n\\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain\\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a\\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\\nevidence.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one\\'s\\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\\n    simple and dignified.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDiogenes\\n', 'From: rdippold@qualcomm.com (Ron \"Asbestos\" Dippold)\\nSubject: Re: Wiretapping reality today\\nOriginator: rdippold@qualcom.qualcomm.com\\nNntp-Posting-Host: qualcom.qualcomm.com\\nOrganization: Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA\\nLines: 24\\n\\nstrnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:\\n>Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is\\n>listening in on everything and one will have to hide one\\'s clipper messages\\n>somehow if non-escrowed crypto goes away.\\n>A little perspective might be in order.\\n\\nRight.

Instead\\nhe ordered the murder of the children.\\n\\n\\nIn order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\\nthe words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \\nsuicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given\\nthe BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met\\nby gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter\\nclaim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the \\nAFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier\\ngrade weaponry than standard issue handguns.

The B-D were\\nquite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any\\ntime. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have\\nachieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of \\nmagintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes\\nand Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch \\napocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties\\nthan 80.\\n\\nAllowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious\\nrisk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the \\nquestion of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over\\na prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared\\nKoresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go\\nin prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.\\n\\n\\nCan you think of a better way of getting the children out?\\n\\nA 100% certain way?\\n\\n\\nThe people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire\\ngovernment story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for \\nthem to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require\\nthem to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come\\nup with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to\\nset out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them\\nto get gun control legislation through.\\n\\nThis conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its\\nagents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the\\nmiddle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.\\n\\nStill the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that\\nWACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in \\nresolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a \\ncomparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it\\ncould be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it\\nrests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular\\nthe person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF\\nagents and 17 children on his or her conscience.\\n\\n\\nThere are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society\\npreach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the\\nvery people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO\\nmay not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group\\nof the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example\\nand holding several hundred children hostage.\\n\\nThe only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent\\nthem arising.

Normal {asynchronous}\\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \\n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit}.\\n\\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \\nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\\n\\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.\\n\", 'From: jbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com\\nSubject: Re: Death Penalty / Gulf War (long)\\nLines: 346\\n\\nIn article <930420.105805.0x8.rusnews.w165w@mantis.co.uk>, mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\\n> jbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com writes:\\n>>In article <930419.115707.6f2.rusnews.w165w@mantis.co.uk>, mathew\\n>><mathew@mantis.co.uk> writes:\\n>>> Which \"liberal news media\" are we talking about?\\n>> \\n>> Western news in general, but in particular the American \"mass media\":\\n>> CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole\\n>> war was one of \"those poor, poor Iraqis\" along with \"look how precisely\\n>> this cruise missile blew this building to bits\".\\n> \\n> Most odd.

Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\\nthe plate in his rookie year.\\n\\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won\\'t be as awful as he was in his last 2\\nstarts. BUt don\\'t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\\nseason, they will miss Redus\\'s clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\\n\\n\\n-Pravin Ratnam\\n', 'From: s8719667@cse.unsw.edu.au (D W Austin)\\nSubject: Re: Anti-aliasing & Raytracing Question:\\nNntp-Posting-Host: rouge.spectrum.cs.unsw.oz.au\\nReply-To: s8719667@cse.unsw.edu.au (D W Austin)\\nOrganization: none\\nLines: 20\\n\\nIn article <1slb46$lbu@mserv1.dl.ac.uk> g.coulter@daresbury.ac.uk writes:\\n>Hi Everyone :-\\n>\\n>I was woundering if someone could answer a simple\\n>query for me on RayTracing and anti-aliasing ....\\n>\\n[stuff deleted]\\n>\\nI have a similiar question relating to anti-alaising that my friend has asked\\nto have posted to the more knowledgable in this group.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE?

You got me thinking now!\\n\\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \\nmove in society to classify previously \"socially unacceptable\" yet legal \\nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).  I\\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \\nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\\n\\n\\t1) A high education level,\\n\\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\\n\\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\\n\\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \\nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\\\\ncan\\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \\nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \\nthose freedoms don\\'t impinge on another\\'s.\\n\\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \\nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \\nin order to \"stabilize\" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \\nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \\nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.\\'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is \\npossible to live with a \"non-stable\" society?\\n\\nAnybody see a way out?  Comments?\\n\\nPS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don\\'t.

Not a chance.\\n\\n>\\n The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992\\n>\\n Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war\\n -------------------------------------------\\n>\\n Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in\\n the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from\\n Agdam\\n ------\\n>\\n Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt\\n roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier\\n times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off\\n the map.\\n>\\n .......\\n>\\n As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of\\n Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt\\n that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been\\n the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke\\n apart.\\n .......\\n>\\n I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and\\n people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,\\n a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the\\n town, called her community \"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\". She and\\n her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.\\n .......\\n>\\n \"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and\\n the government does nothing.\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,\\n said. \"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\" said Dilbar, his\\n wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in\\n the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.\\n ......\\n>\\n \"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.\\n There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then\\n all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had\\n just entered their trap.\"\\n>\\n The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian\\n forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in\\n the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying\\n as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading\\n towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge\\n from the Armenians.\\n>\\n \"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\" said Omar Veyselov, lying\\n in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \"I saw my wife and\\n daughter fall right by me.\"\\n>\\n People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the\\n loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \" Where is my\\n daughter, where is my son ?\" wailed a mother. \"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\"\\n>\\n Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they\\n tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians\\n were caught in \"crossfire\".\\n .......\\n>\\n\\nSource: The Times, 2 March 1992.\\n\\nCORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH\\n\\nANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO \\nINVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...\\n\\nAs we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw \\nthe scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \\ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \\nmortis. They had been shot.\\n\\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \\nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

They are posted with his permission.  The\\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\\n\\n-------\\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\\nSubject: Clipper Chip\\n\\n\\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday\\'s NY Times,\\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\\nif I have anything wrong):\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \\nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \\nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \\nspecific. I don\\'t know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \\ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \\nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \\nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \\nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \\nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \\nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \\ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \\nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \\nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \\nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \\npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \\nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\\n\\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \\nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \\nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \\nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \\nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \\nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \\nproducing\\n\\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \\nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \\nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \\nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \\ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \\nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \\n\\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\\n\\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \\nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \\nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \\nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\\n\\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \\nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \\nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \\nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \\norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \\nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \\nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford\\'s attorney general (right\\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \\nNo single person or authority should have the power to\\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\\n\\nMartin Hellman\\n\\n----\\n\\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: smb@research.att.com\\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\\n\\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \\nif you also post this message with it in which:\\n\\n1.

The drastic change of environment\\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\\n\\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\\npatients early.\\n\\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\\n\\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons.

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you\\'re a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn\\'t see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn\\'t tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout.

Dr. Teperman \\ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \\nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \\nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \\ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \\na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \\nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \\nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.

This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \\nslate for the Board.\\n\\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\\n\\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\\n\\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\\n\\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \\nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \\nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \\nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \\nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \\nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \\n\\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \\nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \\na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \\naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \\nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \\nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\\n\\nDR.

Al received his heart transplant \\nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \\nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\\n\\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \\nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \\nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \\n     \\nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \\ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \\nand feeling better.  \\n\\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \\nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \\nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \\nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \\ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \\n\\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \\nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg.

A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.

The one most obviously\\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\\nspecify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\\n\\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\\nen entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\\nbrute-force search for it?\\n\\nYou use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\\none or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \\n\\nagrep -3 \"qimwe7l\" bigwordandphraselist\\n\\nfinds that the pattern \"qimwe7l\" is too close to the\\npattern \"imsel\" (part of \"himself\" and a host of others),\\nto be of any cryptographic value as a key.\\n\\nAn error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\\nletters like \"teh\" for \"the\".  A minimally acceptable password\\nwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\\nruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\\n(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\\n*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\\n\\n\\nAnd for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o\\'\\ntypos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\\nsay I want to find out what people think about Gibson\\'s\\nSF book \"Neuromancer\" in the huge SF-Lover\\'s archives.\\nEven with an error distance specification as small as\\nof \"1\" I will find all those people who think the title\\nwas \"Necromancer\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\\n\\nAlso, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\\nat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\\n\\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\\ndon\\'t score the X chi-square \\'birthday\\' hits on message size Y.\\n\\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\\nthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\\nNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\\nNational Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\\n\\nYou can also specify \"fixed\" areas: looking for license\\nplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\\nyou might say:\\n\\nagrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\\n\\nwill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\\n(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\\nalso \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\\nor deletion errors.

As this discharge takes place two things\\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\\n\\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\\n\\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\\nare for the most part useless.

I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf.

Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact.

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \\nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \\nam wrong.  \\n\\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \\ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \\nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \\nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \\nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.

I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \\nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \\nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \\ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \\ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and \\n`Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \\nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \\nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \\nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \\nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \\nriches of knowing Christ.\\n\\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \\nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \\nthey had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \\nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \\nmatzoh balls.:-)) \\n\\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \\nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \\ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \\nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \\n\\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \\nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \\na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \\nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \\nand do not want to ask for it back.\\n\\nAnd while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \\nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \\nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \\nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \\nbeing rooted in the past. \\n\\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess \\naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \\nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\\n\\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all \\nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.

In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter\\'s batting\\naverage in clutch situations was significantly below his batting\\naverage in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think\\nthis is random.  \\n\\nNon-Clutch:\\t1585 AB\\t\\t411 H\\t\\t.259\\nClutch:\\t\\t 338 AB\\t\\t 68 H\\t\\t.201\\n\\nSo what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?\\n\\nWell, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was\\n.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good\\nidea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992\\nhe hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: \\n\\nNon-Clutch:\\t 536 AB\\t\\t144 H\\t\\t.269\\nClutch:\\t\\t  86 AB\\t\\t 20 H\\t\\t.233\\n\\nNo, this doesn\\'t prove any overall statistical trend that can\\nbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of \\nmajor league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993\\nJoe Carter\\'s batting average in the clutch is not going to be\\nas high as his ba in non-clutch situations.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n \\nAs for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is\\nthe editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding\\nclutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.\\nBill James makes numerous references to a player\\'s ability to hit\\nwell in the clutch.

I used to think this was true, but more and more I\\'m becoming\\nconvinced that it\\'s the other way around: among players with the physical\\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\\nchance to do it a lot.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPower\\t\\t\\tNo Power\\n\\n\\tPatient\\t\\tFrank Thomas\\t\\tBrett Butler\\n\\t\\t\\tBarry Bonds\\t\\tOzzie Smith\\n\\t\\t\\tMark McGwire\\t\\tCraig Grebeck\\n\\t\\t\\tBabe Ruth\\t\\tMiller Huggins\\n\\t\\t\\tTed Williams\\t\\tBilly Hamilton\\n\\t\\t\\tRickey Henderson\\tEddie Joost\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Morgan\\t\\tMike Hargrove\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\n\\tImpatient\\tErnie Banks\\t\\tOzzie Guillen\\n\\t\\t\\tDave Kingman\\t\\tShawon Dunston\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Carter\\t\\tAndres Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tGeorge Bell\\t\\tJose Lind\\n\\t\\t\\tKirby Puckett\\t\\tDevon White\\n\\tetc.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \\ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\\nhe\\'s only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n   David M.

Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \\ntheir workstations and X terminals.\\n\\n[last modified 10/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\\n\\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\\n\\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \\never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \\npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \\nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \\n\\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \\n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn\\'t do \\nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \\ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\\n\\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \\nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \\nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\\n\\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \\nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \\nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \\nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \\npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \\nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\\n   (1)\\tYou don\\'t *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn\\'t \\n\\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \\n\\tconnected), and\\n   (2)\\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\\n\\thave to cross the serial interface, and\\n   (3)\\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \\n\\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \\n\\tblocks to compress.\\n\\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \\nNCD\\'s XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \\n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \\netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \\nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \\nimplementation available in R6.\\n\\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nin contrib/ in the following files:\\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\\n\\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\\n\\n\\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton\\'s talk at\\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \\nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\\n\\n\\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\\n\\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \\nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\\n\\ttwm (old): Tom\\'s Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \\nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\\nre-parenting window manager. \\n\\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\\n\\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \\n\\trtl: Siemen\\'s window manager tiles windows so that they don\\'t overlap\\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\\n\\tdxwm: Digital\\'s dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\\n\\thpwm: HP\\'s window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\\n\\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\\n\\ttekwm: Tektronix\\'s window manager offering \\n\\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\\nGuide functionality\\n\\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\\n\\tgwm: Bull\\'s Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\\n\\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\\n\\tpswm: Sun\\'s PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\\n\\tswm: Solbourne\\'s swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\\nfrom the resources file\\n\\ttwm (new): MIT\\'s new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\\n\\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \\nfrom export. [3/92]\\n\\ttvtwm: Tom\\'s Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\\navailable on archive servers\\n\\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun\\'s olwm. It is \\navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\\n\\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF\\'s mwm. A beta version\\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \\nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\\n\\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \\n\\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology\\'s terminals \\n\\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur\\'s (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \\ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\\n\\tvuewm: HP\\'s MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\\n\\t4Dwm: SGI\\'s enhanced MWM\\n\\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\\n\\n\\tIt needn\\'t.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \\nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \\nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \\nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\\n\\t\\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \\nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\\n\\n\\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \\nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \\nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \\nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \\nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\\n[10/90]\\n\\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP\\'s vuewm provide for the \\nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\\napplications and the resource database. \\n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\\n \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC\\'s session manager?\\n\\n\\tDEC\\'s session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \\nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\\n\\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\\n\\n\\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\\nprotocol, however, doesn\\'t provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\\na capability not supported by all systems.\\n\\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \\nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \\nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \\nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \\nkeyboard.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\\n\\n\\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \\nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \\ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\\n\\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \\naccept a translation resource such as:\\n\\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\\\n\\t\\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\\ncharacters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\\ncontrol character you want to include.\\n\\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:\\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\\n    panning for each voice\\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\\n    access to all eight voices\\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\\n\\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\\nto use so I have avoided it.\\n\\nREASON FOR SALE:\\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\\n\\nPRICING AND TERMS:\\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).

From the Revelations passages it is clear that\\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\\nin the sense of continual. \\n \\nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \\nunbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on\\ncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.\\nIt definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid\\nregardless of its exact nature. \\n\\nThere seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:\\nWhat is God's main plan on earth?\\nWhy is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed\\nto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?\\n\\nI believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship\\nwith people.\\n\\nThe nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more\\ndifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something\\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\\nnothing to do with God.\\n\\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\\nto be forever without God. \\n \\nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of\\nthe parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening\\nto the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.\\nIt seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is\\nnot even remotely pleasant.\\n-- \\nPeter White\\ndisclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects \\n     \\t\\t\\ta view of my company.\\n\\tPhil    I want to know Christ and the power of his\\n\\t3:10 \\tresurrection and the fellowship of sharing in\\n\\tNIV\\t\\this sufferings, becoming like him in his death\\t\\n\", 'From: c23st@kocrsv01.delcoelect.com (Spiros Triantafyllopoulos)\\nSubject: Re: Lexus and Infiniti\\nOrganization: Delco Electronics Corp.\\nLines: 19\\n\\nIn article <issa.735601408@cwis> issa@cwis.unomaha.edu (Issa El-Hazin) writes:\\n>Don\\'t the numbers in the car names above refair to the engine size in \\n>liters? i.e. ls400 = 4.0litre engine, sc300 = 3.0 liter \"Sport Coupe\".. \\n>and Q45 = 4.5liter..

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n', 'From: cdm@pmafire.inel.gov (Dale Cook)\\nSubject: Re: Good Neighbor Political Hypocrisy Test\\nOrganization: WINCO\\nLines: 25\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr15.193603.14228@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> rscharfy@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Ryan C Scharfy) writes:\\n>In article <stevethC5JGCr.1Ht@netcom.com> steveth@netcom.com (Steve Thomas) wri\\n>tes:\\n>\\n>>Just _TRY_ to justify the War On Drugs, I _DARE_ you!\\n>\\n>A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid \\n>is still having trouble \"aiming\" for the bowl when he takes a dump.

Yes\\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \\nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \\nlot of memory.\\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \\nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \\nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \\nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \\nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \\nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \\nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \\n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \\nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \\naverage access time of about 25 ms.\\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \\nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \\nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \\nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\\n\\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \\nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \\nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \\n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \\nabout $900. \\n\\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\\n\\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable?

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\", 'From: jws@fc.hp.com (John Schmidt)\\nSubject: Re: Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks\\nNntp-Posting-Host: hpfcjws.fc.hp.com\\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard Fort Collins Site\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9.2]\\nLines: 3\\n\\nThis is normal behavior for these drives (and many other models).

Others claim to be staying of their own free\\nwill, but Jobs\\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\\n\\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to \"have hardware which will blow\\nanything else away\", while more recently he claims they have stopped\\nmanufacturing their own.\\n\\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\\npossibly Canon equipment.\\n\\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as \"Bill\" and\\nclaims to be the \"MS-iah\".\\n\\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\\n\"interpersonal computing\" which rejects traditional roles.\\n\\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\\ncarry Jobs\\' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \"I\\nwant to welcome you to the \\'Next World\\' \".\\n\\n- - -- \\nRoland J.

Look who\\'s talking: \"jumping to conclusions?\"  You wouldn\\'t do\\nthat yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless\\nwhether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points\\nof view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\n#\\n# The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus\\n# is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS\\n# belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.\\n\\nA beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation\\nof lds doctrine.

The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\\n\\nCorrection: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible\\nindeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they\\n\"belong to\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have\\nrebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\"\\nbut it doesn\\'t mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\\nsalvation.\\n\\n#\\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\";\\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\\n\\nSo?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the\\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\\n(and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \\'official doctrine.\\' I don\\'t\\n#  think that it matters if McConkie\\'s views were canon.

The indication from Rick is that they may\\n#  certainly be.\\n\\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\\nis obviously very important.  McConkie\\'s views have been controversial\\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\\nas \"McConkie\\'s Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\\'s books!\\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

Dec. 1989\\n\\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\\n\\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\\nact before the Holocaust.\\n\\nHe said the diaspora\\'s religious and secular leadership had\\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\\nof Judaism\".\\n\\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\\nyears of Jewish history.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua\\'s other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\\noutside Israel \"who were using other people\\'s countries like\\nhotels\".\\n\\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\\nIsrael.\\n\\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\\ncountry\\'s political situation.\\n\\nHe said Israel\\'s wars had once provided writers with a vital\\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\\nproduced about the intifada.\\n\\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\\nIsraeli Arab\\'s shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\\ncharacter\".\\n\\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\\n\\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\\ncountry they lived in, he said.\\n\\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\\nliterary circles.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I\\'d like to\\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\\nthis point.  Well, my group\\'s plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\\'s PaletteBook\\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \\nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\\napplications, color screens aren\\'t really a neccessity.  We could\\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\\n\\nNow, please don\\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\\nvia email and let me know:\\n1. If you would consider buying a \"full page\" laptop screen\\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\\n3.

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\\'s borders, when Israel was\\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\\'s opportunities for\\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them.

Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".

It\\'s like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\\nC.  They can\\'t afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we\\'d have\\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can\\'t in\\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\\nlegal, but it hasn\\'t been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\\nbut some people object.  They don\\'t like the idea of their tax money going\\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\\nwomen who can\\'t afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don\\'t see any\\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\\nobjections to it.

No current is supposed to flow in it\\nunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in\\nit either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if\\nyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  \\n\\nThe neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for\\nthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you\\nplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly \\nmeasure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  \\n\\nThey are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,\\nrepeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things\\nlike sub-panels.)\\n\\nWhat you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \\nto use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\\ndepending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\\n\\nThere is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and\\nnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and\\nyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy\\nto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in\\nthe future. \\n\\n\\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\\n\\n\", 'From: seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.)

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.

In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n', 'From: eifrig@beanworld.cs.jhu.edu (Jonathan Eifrig)\\nSubject: Re: Pgp, PEM, and RFC\\'s (Was: Cryptography Patents)\\nOrganization: The Johns Hopkins University CS Department\\nLines: 70\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr16.001321.3692@natasha.portal.com> bob@natasha.portal.com\\n(Bob Cain) writes:\\n\\n>  Check your facts first and grow up.\\n>Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography\\n>and immaturity I wonder.\\n\\n\\tHmmm.  \"Check your facts.\"  Good advice.
